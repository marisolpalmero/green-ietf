 Requirements for Energy Efficiency Management, 11 years after the EMAN
                                RFC6988
                     draft-eman-green-rfc6988bis-01

Abstract

   This document defines requirements for standards specifications for
   Energy Management, taking RFC6988 as a starting point.  Eleven years
   after the RFC 6988 publication, this document re-evaluates the
   requirements.  The requirements defined in this document are
   concerned with discovery f unctions, monitoring functions as well as
   control functions.  Discovery functions include identifying energy-
   managed network, devices and their components, discovery of inventory
   of power components capabilities, optimization control capabilities,
   nominal condition use.  Monitoring functions include monitoring their
   Power States, Power Attributes, energy consumption, network
   performance, energy efficiency metrics.  Control functions include
   such functions as controlling energy saving and optimization
   functions and Power State of energy-managed devices and their
   components.

   This document does not specify the features that must be implemented
   by compliant implementations but rather lists features that must be
   supported by standards for Energy efficiency Management.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  In Preparation of the GREEN BoF at IETF 120

   The EMAN (Energy MANagement) working group, created in 2010 and now
   concluded, has produced multiples RFCs

     * {{RFC7603}}, Energy Management (EMAN) Applicability Statement

     * {{RFC7577}}, Definition of Managed Objects for Battery Monitoring

     * {{RFC7460}}, Monitoring and Control MIB for Power and Energy

     * {{RFC7461}}, Energy Object Context MIB

     * {{RFC7326}}, Energy Management Framework

     * {{RFC6988}}, Requirements for Energy Management

     * {{RFC6933}}, Entity MIB (Version 4)

   Note also that some other energy-related MIB modules have been
   created, but not by the EMAN Working Group

     * {{RFC3433}}, Entity Sensor MIB module

     * {{RFC3621}}, Power Ethernet MIB modules

     * {{RFC1628}}, UPS Power Monitoring MIB module

     * LLDP MIB module and LLDP MED MIB module

   Due to limitations regarding Writeable MIB module, one IESG statement
   published in 2014 encourages the use the NETCONF/YANG standards for
   configuration.  Based on the YANG modules developments, three MIB
   modules (Entity MIB module, Entity Sensor MIB module, Entity State
   MIB module) have been converted into the "YANG Data Model for
   Hardware Management" {?RFC8348}}.

   However, Power and Energy Monitoring and Control MIB modules has not
   been converted yet into YANG modules.

   Eleven years after the EMAN requirements RFC 6988 publication, this
   document re-evaluates the energy-related requirements, as a
   preparation for the GREEN BoF at IETF 120.

1.2.  High-level Differences with RFC6988

   The following section will delve into the specific details but from a
   high level point of view, the differences between this document and
   the RFC6988 are:







Claise, et al.           Expires 21 January 2025                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


  - New definition for "Energy Efficiency Management"

  - A focus towards YANG, and not any longer on MIB modules

  - As a consequence from the previous point, the ENTITY-MIB v4 (RFC6933) is replaced by the Hardware YANG module RFC8348

  - No focus on the battery management (as batteries haves some self-optimization features these days)

  - Less focus on the Power over Ethernet management

  - A focus on reporting lifecycle management, considering energy and transformation towards carbon awareness

1.3.  Background

   With rising energy costs and an increasing awareness of the
   environmental impact of running information technology equipment,
   Energy efficiency Management functions and management interfaces are
   becoming an additional basic requirement for network management
   systems and devices connected to a network.

   This document defines requirements for standards specifications for
   Energy efficiency Management, including discovery functions,
   monitoring functions and control functions.  Energy efficiency
   Management functions focus mainly on network devices and their built-
   in components that receive and provide electrical energy.  Devices
   such as switches, routers, servers and storage devices should have an
   IP address providing a management interface for the network device.
   Alternatively, energy-related devices (for example, in building
   management, which typically don't support IP) might be connected via
   a proxy/gateway with an IP address.

   These requirements are concerned with the standards specification
   process and not the implementation of specified standards.  All
   requirements in this document must be reflected by standards
   specifications to be developed.  However, which of the features
   specified by these standards will be mandatory, recommended, or
   optional for compliant implementations is to be defined by Standards
   Track document(s) and not in this document.

   Section 3 elaborates on a set of general needs for Energy Management.
   Requirements for an Energy Management standard are specified in
   Sections 4 through 8.

   Sections 4 through 6 contain conventional requirements specifying
   information on entities and control functions.






Claise, et al.           Expires 21 January 2025                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


   Sections 7 and 8 contain requirements specific to Energy Management.
   Due to the nature of power supply, some monitoring and control
   functions are not conducted by interacting with the entity of
   interest but rather with other entities, for example, entities
   upstream in a power distribution tree.

1.4.  Conventional Requirements for Energy Efficiency Management

   The specification of requirements for an Energy Efficiency Management
   standard starts with Section 4, which addresses the identification of
   entities and the granularity of reporting of energy-related
   information.  A standard must support the unique identification of
   entities, reporting per network, per entire device, and reporting
   energy-related information on individual components of a device or
   attached devices.

   Section 5 specifies requirements related to the monitoring of
   entities.  This includes general (type, context) information and
   specific information on Power States, Power Inlets, Power Outlets,
   power, energy.  The control of Power State and power saving
   functionalities, optimization functionalities by entities is covered
   by requirements specified in Section 6.

1.5.  Specific Requirements for Energy Management

   While the conventional requirements summarized above seem to be all
   that would be needed for Energy Management, there are significant
   differences between Energy Management and most well-known network
   management functions.  The most significant difference is the need
   for some devices to report on other entities.  There are two major
   reasons for this.

   o For monitoring a particular entity, it is not always sufficient to
   communicate only with that entity.  When the entity has no
   instrumentation for determining power, it might still be possible to
   obtain power values for the entity via communication with other
   entities in its power distribution tree.  A simple example of this
   would be the retrieval of power values from a power meter at the
   power line into the entity.  A Power Distribution Unit (PDU) and a
   Power over Ethernet (PoE) switch are common examples.  Both supply
   power to other entities at sockets or ports, respectively, and are
   often instrumented to measure power per socket or port.  Also it
   could be considered to obtain power values for the entity via
   communication with other entities outside of the power distribution
   tree, like for example external databases or even data sheets.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


   o Similar considerations apply to controlling the power supply of an
   entity that often needs direct or indirect communications with
   another entity upstream in the power distribution tree.  Again, a PDU
   and a PoE switch are common examples, if they have the capability to
   switch power on or off at their sockets or ports, respectively.

   These specific issues of Energy Management, as well as other issues,
   are covered by requirements specified in Sections 7 and 8.

   The requirements in these sections need a new Energy Management
   framework that deals with the specific nature of Energy Management.
   The actual standards documents, such as MIB module specifications,
   address conformance by specifying which features must, should, or may
   be implemented by compliant implementations.

2.  Terminology

   The terms specified in the terminology section are capitalized
   throughout the document; the exceptions are the well-known terms
   "energy" and "power".  These terms are generic and are used in
   generated terms such as "energy-saving", "low-power", etc.

   Embedded carbon (or embodied carbon)

     The total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, measured in tonnes
     of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e), associated with the entire lifecycle
     of a product or material, from raw material extraction through
     manufacturing, transportation, use, and end-of-life disposal or
     recycling.

   Embodied energy

     The total amount of energy consumed in all processes associated
     with the production of a building material or product, from the
     extraction and processing of raw materials, through manufacturing,
     transportation, and installation, to the end of its useful life,
     including disposal or recycling.

   Energy

     Energy is the capacity of a system to do work.  As used by
     electric utilities, it is generally a reference to electrical
     energy and is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) [IEEE-100].

   Power

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


     Power is the time rate at which energy is emitted, transferred, or
     received; power is usually expressed in watts (or in joules per
     second) [IEEE-100].  (The term "power" does not refer to the
     concept of demand, which is an averaged power value.)

   Power Attributes

     Power Attributes are measurements of electric current, voltage,
     phase, and frequencies at a given point in an electrical power
     system (adapted from [IEC.60050]).

     NOTE: Power Attributes are not intended to be "judgmental" with
     respect to a reference or technical value and are independent of
     any usage context.

   Energy Management

     Energy Management is a set of functions for measuring, modeling,
     planning, and optimizing networks to ensure that the network
     elements and attached devices use energy efficiently and in a
     manner appropriate to the nature of the application and the cost
     constraints of the organization [ITU-M.3400].

   Energy Efficiency Management

    Involves deploying and managing network infrastructures with the
    goal of optimizing energy use on network devices while improving
    the overall network utilization.

   Energy Management System

     An Energy Management System is a combination of hardware and
     software used to administer a network with the primary purpose
     being Energy Management.

   Energy Monitoring

  Energy Monitoring is a part of Energy Efficiency Management that deals with
  collecting or reading information from network elements and their components to aid in
  Energy Efficiency Management.

     A Power Interface is an interface at which a device is connected
     to a power transmission medium, at which it can in turn receive
     power, provide power, or both.

   Power Inlet

     A Power Inlet is a Power Interface at which a device can receive
     power from other devices.

   Power Outlet

     A Power Outlet is a Power Interface at which a device can provide
     power to other devices.

   Power State

     A Power State is a condition or mode of a device that broadly
     characterizes its capabilities, power consumption, and
     responsiveness to input [IEEE-1621].

3.  General Considerations Related to Energy Management

   The basic objective of Energy Efficiency Management is to operate
   sets of network devices using minimal energy, while maintaining a
   certain level of service.

3.1.  Power States

   Entities can be set to an operational state that results in the
   lowest power level that still meets the service-level performance
   objectives.  In principle, there are three basic types of Power
   States for an entity or for a whole system:

   o full Power State

   o sleep state (not functional but immediately available)

   o off state (may require significant time to become operational)













Claise, et al.           Expires 21 January 2025               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


   In specific network devices, the number of Power States and their
   properties vary considerably.  Simple entities may only have the
   extreme states: full Power State and off state.  Many network devices
   have three basic Power States: on, off, and sleep.  However, more
   finely grained Power States can be implemented, especially when
   Energy efficiency gains for communication systems are highly sought
   after, for environmental, business, and technical reasons.  Examples
   are various operational low Power States in which a network device
   requires less energy than in the full power "on" state, but --
   compared to the sleep state -- is still operational with reduced
   performance or functionality.

   Another example is standby power state in which network device has
   multiple standby components and one active component for the same
   functionality, standby components are partially functional and can be
   immediately available when active component is down.  The standby
   power state can be introduced to save energy while impove the overall
   network utilization.

3.2.  Saving Energy versus Maintaining Service Level

   One of the objectives of Energy Efficiency Management is to reduce
   energy consumption.  While this objective is clear, attaining that
   goal is often difficult.  In many cases, there is no way to reduce
   power without the consequence of a potential service (performance or
   capacity) degradation.  In this case, a trade-off needs to be made
   between service-level objectives (e.g., network performance) and
   energy minimization.  In other cases, a reduction of power can easily
   be achieved while still maintaining sufficient service-level
   performance, for example, by switching entities to lower Power States
   when higher performance is not needed.  To measure of the trade-off
   between service-level object and energy consumption, a new set of
   energy efficiency metrics needs to defined.

3.3.  Local versus Network-Wide Energy Management

   Many energy-saving functions are executed locally by an entity; it
   monitors its usage and dynamically adapts its power according to the
   required performance.  It may, for example, switch to a sleep state
   or backup state when it is not in use, or outside of scheduled
   business hours.  An Energy Efficiency Management System may observe
   an entity's Power State and configure or optimize its power-saving
   policies.








Claise, et al.           Expires 21 January 2025               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


   Energy savings can also be achieved with policies implemented by a
   network management system that controls Power States of managed
   entities.  Information about the power received and provided by
   entities in different Power States may be required in order to set
   such policies.  Often, this information is best acquired through
   monitoring.

   Network-wide and local Energy Management methods both have advantages
   and disadvantages, and it is often desirable to combine them.
   Central management is often favorable for setting Power States of a
   large number of entities at the same time, for example, at the
   beginning and end of business hours in a building.  Local management
   is often preferable for power-saving measures based on local
   observations, such as the high or low functional load of an entity.

3.4.  Energy Monitoring versus Energy Saving

   Monitoring energy, power, and Power States alone does not reduce the
   energy needed to run an entity.  In fact, it may even increase it
   slightly due to monitoring instrumentation that needs energy.
   Reporting measured quantities over the network may also increase
   energy use, though the acquired information may be an essential input
   to control loops that save energy.

   Monitoring energy and Power States can also be required for other
   purposes, including:

   o investigating energy-saving potential

   o evaluating the effectiveness of energy-saving policies and measures

   o deriving, implementing, and testing power management strategies

   o accounting for the total power received and provided by an entity,
   a network, or a service

   o predicting an entity's reliability based on power usage

   o choosing the time of the next maintenance cycle for an entity

3.5.  Overview of Energy Management Requirements

   The following basic management functions are required:

   o monitoring Power States

   o monitoring power (energy conversion rate)




Claise, et al.           Expires 21 January 2025               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


   o monitoring (accumulated) received and provided energy

   o monitoring Power Attributes

   o setting Power States

   In addition, to support energy efficiency management, additional
   requirements concerned with discovery functions and control functions
   are introduced:

   o discovering energy-managed network, devices and their components

   o discovering inventory of power components together with their
   capabilities, optimization control capabilities, nominal condition
   use

   o discovering supported power state of each network device within the
   network

   o discovering power relationship between component within network
   device and across network devices.

   o support additional energy efficiency metrics for energy efficiency
   monitoring, e.g., heat consumption, energy efficiency ratio, maximum
   wake up time, etc.

   o support separation of desired power state and actual power state
   and optimize energy usage to allow update actual power state to match
   desired power state.

   o Introduce energy saving method, and energy efficiency metrics to
   support explicit power control or energy efficiency optimization and
   control.

   o allow control and optimize energy usage to make the trade-off
   between network performance and power consumption.

   o support both local management and network wide management based on
   energy saving functionality.

   Energy usage control and optimization is complementary to other
   energy-saving design, such as low-power electronics, energy-efficient
   device design (for example, low-power modes for components), and
   energy-efficient network architectures and is exercised using
   management interface.  Measurement of received and provided energy
   can provide useful data for energy efficiency management.

4.  Identification of Entities

   Entities must be capable of being uniquely identified within the
   context of the management system.  This includes entities that are
   components of managed devices as well as entire devices or the entire
   network.

   Entities that report on or control other entities must identify the
   entities they report on or control: see Section 7 or Section 8,
   respectively, for the detailed requirements.

   An entity may be an entire network, or network device or a component
   of it.  Examples of components of interest are a hard drive, a fan,
   or a line card.  The ability to control individual components to save
   energy may be required.  For example, server blades can be switched
   off when the overall load is low, or line cards at switches may be
   powered down at night.

   Identifiers for network, network devices and components are already
   defined in standard YANG modules Network Topology YANG module
   [RFC8345] and Hardware YANG module [RFC8348].  Note that Network
   Topology YANG module [RFC8345] identifiers are reused in the Network
   Inventory YANG module [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang] and are
   also the basis for the Digital Map Modeling efforts in the NMOP
   Working Group.

   Instrumentation for measuring the received and provided energy of a
   device is typically more expensive than instrumentation for
   retrieving its Power State.  Many devices may provide Power State
   information for all individual components separately, while reporting
   the received and provided energy only for the entire device.

4.1.  Identifying Entities

   The standard must provide means for uniquely identifying entities.
   Uniqueness must be preserved such that collisions of identities are
   avoided at potential receivers of monitored information.

4.2.  Identifying Entitiy Capabilities

   The standard must provide means for discovering inventory of power
   components together with their capabilities, optimization control
   capabilities, nominal condition use.  In addition, The standard must
   provide means for discovering supported power state of each network
   device within the network and power relationship between component
   within network device and across network devices.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


4.3.  Persistence of Identifiers

   The standard must provide means for indicating whether identifiers of
   entities are persistent across a restart of the entity.

4.4.  Change of Identifiers

   The standard must provide means to indicate any change of entity
   identifiers.

4.5.  Using Entity Identifiers of Existing YANG Modules

   The standard must provide means for reusing entity identifiers from
   existing standards, including at least the following:

   o the network-id, link-id, node-id, port-id of the Network Topology
   YANG module [RFC8345]

   o the ne-id, Universal Unique IDentifier (UUID) of the network
   element and component-id, UUID of each component within the network
   element in Network Inventory YANG module
   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang]

   o the name, UUID of each hardware component in the Hardware YANG
   module [RFC8348]

   Generic means for reusing other entity identifiers must be provided.

5.  Information on Entities

   This section describes information on entities for which the standard
   must provide means for retrieving and reporting.

   Required information can be structured into seven groups.
   Section 5.1 specifies requirements for general information on
   entities, such as type of entity or context information.
   Requirements for information on Power Inlets and Power Outlets of
   entities are specified in Section 5.2.  The monitoring of power and
   energy is covered by Sections 5.3 and 5.5, respectively.  Section 5.4
   covers requirements related to entities' Power States.  Section 5.6
   specifies requirements for monitoring batteries.  Finally, the
   reporting of time series of values is covered by Section 5.7.

5.1.  General Information on Entities

   For Energy Management, understanding the role and context of an
   entity may be required.  An Energy Management System may aggregate
   values of received and provided energy according to a defined
   grouping of entities.  When controlling and setting Power States, it
   may be helpful to understand the grouping of the entity and role of
   an entity in a network.  For example, it may be important to exclude
   some mission-critical network devices from being switched to lower
   power or even from being switched off.

5.1.1.  Type of Entity

   The standard must provide means to configure, retrieve, and report a
   textual name or a description of an entity.

5.1.2.  Context of an Entity

   The standard must provide means for retrieving and reporting context
   information on entities, for example, tags associated with an entity
   that indicate the entity's role.

5.1.3.  Significance of Entities

   The standard must provide means for retrieving and reporting the
   significance of entities within its context, for example, how
   important the entity is.

5.1.4.  Power Priority

   The standard must provide means for retrieving and reporting power
   priorities of entities.  Power priorities indicate an order in which
   Power States of entities are changed, for example, to lower Power
   States for saving power.

5.1.5.  Grouping of Entities

   The standard must provide means for grouping entities.  This can be
   achieved in multiple ways, for example, by providing means to tag
   entities, assign them to domains, or assign device types to them.

5.2.  Power Interfaces

   A Power Interface is an interface at which a device is connected to a
   power transmission medium, at which it can in turn receive power,
   provide power, or both.





Claise, et al.           Expires 21 January 2025               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


   A Power Interface is either an inlet or an outlet.  Some Power
   Interfaces change over time from being an inlet to being an outlet
   and vice versa.  However, most Power Interfaces never change.

   Network Devices have Power Inlets at which they are supplied with
   electric power.  Most devices have a single Power Inlet, while some
   have multiple inlets.  Different Power Inlets on a device are often
   connected to separate power distribution trees.  For Energy
   Monitoring, it is useful to retrieve information on the number of
   inlets of a device, the availability of power at inlets, and which
   inlets are actually in use.

   Network Devices can have one or more Power Outlets for supplying
   other devices with electric power.

   For identifying and potentially controlling the source of power
   received at an inlet, identifying the Power Outlet of another network
   device at which the received power is provided may be required.
   Analogously, for each outlet, it is of interest to identify the Power
   Inlets that receive the power provided at a certain outlet.  Such
   information is also required for constructing the wiring topology of
   electrical power distribution to devices.

   Static properties of each Power Interface are required information
   for Energy Efficiency Management.  Static properties include the kind
   of electric current (AC or DC), the nominal voltage, the nominal AC
   frequency, and the number of AC phases.  Note that the nominal
   voltage is often not a single value but a voltage range, such as, for
   example, (100V-120V), (100V-240V), (100V-120V,220V-240V).

5.2.1.  List of Power Interfaces

   The standard must provide means for monitoring the list of Power
   Interfaces of a device.

5.2.2.  Operational Mode of Power Interfaces

   The standard must provide means for monitoring the operational mode
   of a Power Interface, which is either "Power Inlet" or "Power
   Outlet".

5.2.3.  Corresponding Power Outlet

   The standard must provide means for identifying the Power Outlet that
   provides the power received at a Power Inlet.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


5.2.4.  Corresponding Power Inlets

   The standard must provide means for identifying the list of Power
   Inlets that receive the power provided at a Power Outlet.

5.2.5.  Availability of Power

   If the Power States allow it, the standard must provide means for
   monitoring the availability of power at each Power Interface.  This
   includes indicating whether a power supply at a Power Interface is
   switched on or off.

5.2.6.  Use of Power

   The standard must provide means for monitoring each Power Interface
   if it is actually in use.  For inlets, this means that the device
   actually receives power at the inlet.  For outlets, this means that
   power is actually provided from the outlet to one or more devices.

5.2.7.  Type of Current

   The standard must provide means for reporting the type of current (AC
   or DC) for each Power Interface as well as for a device.

5.2.8.  Nominal Voltage Range

   The standard must provide means for reporting the nominal voltage
   range for each Power Interface.

5.2.9.  Nominal AC Frequency

   The standard must provide means for reporting the nominal AC
   frequency for each Power Interface.

5.2.10.  Number of AC Phases

   The standard must provide means for reporting the number of AC phases
   for each Power Interface.

5.3.  Power

   Power is measured as an instantaneous value or as the average over a
   time interval.








Claise, et al.           Expires 21 January 2025               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


   Obtaining highly accurate values for power and energy may be costly
   if dedicated metering hardware is required.  Entities without the
   ability to measure with high accuracy their power, received energy,
   and provided energy may just report estimated values, for example,
   based on load monitoring, Power State, or even just the entity type.

   Depending on how power and energy values are obtained, the confidence
   in a reported value and its accuracy will vary.  Entities reporting
   such values should qualify the confidence in the reported values and
   quantify the accuracy of measurements.  For reporting accuracy, the
   accuracy classes specified in IEC 62053-21 [IEC.62053-21] and IEC
   62053-22 [IEC.62053-22] should be considered.

   Further properties of the power supplied to a device are also of
   interest.  For AC power supply in particular, several Power
   Attributes beyond the real power are of potential interest to Energy
   Management Systems.  The set of these properties includes the complex
   Power Attributes (apparent power, reactive power, and phase angle of
   the current or power factor) as well as the actual voltage, the
   actual AC frequency, the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of voltage
   and current, and the impedance of an AC phase or of the DC supply.  A
   new standard for monitoring these Power Attributes should be in line
   with already-existing standards, such as [IEC.61850-7-4].

   For some network management tasks, it is desirable to receive
   notifications from entities when their power value exceeds or falls
   below given thresholds.

5.3.1.  Real Power / Power Factor

   The standard must provide means for reporting the real power for each
   Power Interface as well as for an entity.  Reporting power includes
   reporting the direction of power flow.

5.3.2.  Power Measurement Interval

   The standard must provide means for reporting the corresponding time
   or time interval for which a power value is reported.  The power
   value can be measured at the corresponding time or averaged over the
   corresponding time interval.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


5.3.3.  Power Measurement Method

   The standard must provide means to indicate the method used to obtain
   these values.  Based on how the measurement was conducted, it is
   possible to associate a certain degree of confidence with the
   reported power value.  For example, there are methods of measurement
   such as direct power measurement, estimation based on performance
   values, or hard-coding average power values for an entity.

5.3.4.  Accuracy of Power and Energy Values

   The standard must provide means for reporting the accuracy of
   reported power and energy values.

5.3.5.  Actual Voltage and Current

   The standard must provide means for reporting the actual voltage and
   actual current for each Power Interface as well as for a device.  For
   AC power supply, means must be provided for reporting the actual
   voltage and actual current per phase.

5.3.6.  High-Power/Low-Power Notifications

   The standard must provide means for creating notifications if power
   values of an entity rise above or fall below given thresholds.

5.3.7.  Complex Power / Power Factor

   The standard must provide means for reporting the complex power for
   each Power Interface and for each phase at a Power Interface.  In
   addition to the real power, at least two of the following three
   quantities need to be reported: apparent power, reactive power, and
   phase angle.  The phase angle can be substituted by the power factor.

5.3.8.  Actual AC Frequency

   The standard must provide means for reporting the actual AC frequency
   for each Power Interface.

5.3.9.  Total Harmonic Distortion

   The standard must provide means for reporting the Total Harmonic
   Distortion (THD) of voltage and current for each Power Interface.
   For AC power supply, means must be provided for reporting the THD per
   phase.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


5.3.10.  Power Supply Impedance

   The standard must provide means for reporting the impedance of a
   power supply for each Power Interface.  For AC power supply, means
   must be provided for reporting the impedance per phase.

5.4.  Power State

   Many entities have a limited number of discrete Power States.

   There is a need to report the actual Power State of an entity and to
   provide the means for retrieving the list of all supported Power
   States.

   Different standards bodies have already defined sets of Power States
   for some entities, and others are creating new Power State sets.  In
   this context, it is desirable that the standard support many of these
   Power State standards.  In order to support multiple management
   systems that possibly use different Power State sets while
   simultaneously interfacing with a particular entity, the Energy
   Management System must provide means for supporting multiple Power
   State sets used simultaneously at an entity.

   Power States have parameters that describe their properties.  It is
   required to have a standardized means for reporting some key
   properties, such as the typical power of an entity in a certain
   state.

   There is also a need to report statistics on Power States, including
   the time spent as well as the received and provided energy in a Power
   State.

5.4.1.  Actual Power State

   The standard must provide means for reporting the actual Power State
   of an entity.

5.4.2.  List of Supported Power States

   The standard must provide means for retrieving the list of all
   potential Power States of an entity.

5.4.3.  Multiple Power State Sets

   The standard must provide means for supporting multiple Power State
   sets simultaneously at an entity.

5.4.4.  List of Supported Power State Sets

   The standard must provide means for retrieving the list of all Power
   State sets supported by an entity.

5.4.5.  List of Supported Power States within a Set

   The standard must provide means for retrieving the list of all
   potential Power States of an entity for each supported Power State
   set.

5.4.6.  Typical Power Per Power State

   The standard must provide means for retrieving the typical power for
   each supported Power State.

5.4.7.  Power State Statistics

   The standard must provide means for monitoring statistics per Power
   State, including the total time spent in a Power State, the number of
   times each state was entered, and the last time each state was
   entered.  More Power State statistics are addressed by the
   requirements in Section 5.5.3.

5.4.8.  Power State Changes

   The standard must provide means for generating a notification when
   the actual Power State of an entity changes.

5.5.  Energy

   The monitoring of electrical energy received or provided by an entity
   is a core function of Energy Management.  Since energy is an
   accumulated quantity, it is always reported for a certain interval of
   time.  This can be, for example, the time from the last restart of
   the entity to the reporting time, the time from another past event to
   the reporting time, the last given amount of time before the
   reporting time, or a certain interval specified by two timestamps in
   the past.

   It is useful for entities to record their received and provided
   energy per Power State and report these quantities.

   In addition, it is also useful for entities to record energy
   attributes such as maximum wake up time, maximum sleep time, service
   interruption time, transition time, maximum packet throughput,
   maximum bit throughput and report these quantities.

5.5.1.  Energy Measurement

   The standard must provide means for reporting measured values of
   energy and the direction of the energy flow received or provided by
   an entity.  The standard must also provide the means to report the
   energy passing through each Power Interface.

5.5.2.  Energy Efficiency Measurement

   The standard must provide means for measuring the trade-off between
   service-level object and energy consumption.  [ETSI-ES-203-136],
   [ITUT-L.1310], [ATIS-0600015.03.2013] provide methodology and test
   procedure for measuring such energy efficiency related metrics, which
   is defined as the throughput forwarded by 1 watt.  The traffic loads
   and the weighted multipliers need to be clearly established in
   advance.

   Note that, based on the specific optimization policy (throughput,
   heat, energy source, etc.), different derived metrics should be
   computed at the controller level.

5.5.3.  Power Gain Measurement

   The standard must provide means for measuring power gain, which can
   be calculated by actual power to be consumed by the entity divided by
   the maximum power of the entity.  In addition, the minimum power gain
   can also be measured and reported.

5.5.4.  Time Intervals

   The standard must provide means for reporting the time interval for
   which an energy value is reported.

5.5.5.  Energy Per Power State

   The standard must provide means for reporting the received and
   provided energy for each individual Power State.  This extends the
   requirements on Power State statistics described in Section 5.4.7.

5.6.  Obsolete Battery State from RFC6988

   Batteries are built in component within a network device and have no
   difference with other built in components such as power supply.
   Therefore there is no need to monitor the battery status of these
   entities by network management systems separately.

   This document proposes to obsolete battery state from RFC6988.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


5.7.  Time Series of Measured Values

   For some network management tasks, obtaining time series of measured
   values from entities, such as power, energy, battery charge, etc., is
   required.

   In general, time series measurements could be obtained in many
   different ways.  Means should be provided to either push such values
   from the location where they are available to the management system
   or to have them stored locally for a sufficiently long period of time
   such that a management system can retrieve the full time series.

   The following issues are to be considered when designing time series
   measurement and reporting functions:

   1.  Which quantities should be reported?

   2.  Which time interval type should be used (total, delta, sliding
       window)?

   3.  Which measurement method should be used (sampled, continuous)?

   4.  Which reporting model should be used (push or pull)?

   The most discussed and probably most needed quantity is energy.  But
   a need for others, such as power and battery charge, can be
   identified as well.

   There are three time interval types under discussion for accumulated
   quantities such as energy.  They can be reported as total values,
   accumulated between the last restart of the measurement and a certain
   timestamp.  Alternatively, energy can be reported as delta values
   between two consecutive timestamps.  Another alternative is reporting
   values for sliding windows as specified in [IEC.61850-7-4].

   For non-accumulative quantities, such as power, different measurement
   methods are considered.  Such quantities can be reported using values
   sampled at certain timestamps or, alternatively, by mean values for
   these quantities averaged between two (consecutive) timestamps or
   over a sliding window.

   Finally, time series can be reported using different reporting
   models, particularly push-based or pull-based.  Push-based reporting
   can, for example, be realized by reporting power or energy values
   using the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The NETCONF a protocol can
   also be used to realize pull-based reporting of time series.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


   For reporting time series of measured values, the following
   requirements have been identified.  Further decisions concerning
   issues discussed above need to be made when developing concrete
   Energy Management standards.

5.7.1.  Time Series of Energy Values

   The standard must provide means for reporting time series of energy
   values.  If the comparison of time series between multiple entities
   is required, then time synchronization between those entities must be
   provided (for example, with the Network Time Protocol [RFC5905]).

5.7.2.  Time Series Interval Types

   The standard must provide means for supporting alternative interval
   types.  The requirement in Section 5.5.2 applies to every reported
   time value.

5.7.3.  Time Series Storage Capacity

   The standard should provide means for reporting the number of values
   of a time series that can be stored for later reporting.

6.  Reporting on Lifecycle Management

   Lifecycle information related to manufacturing energy costs,
   transport, recyclability, and end-of-life disposal impacts is part of
   what is called "embedded carbon."  This information is considered to
   be an estimated value, which might not be implemented today in the
   network devices.  It might be part of the vendor information, and to
   be collected from datasheets or databases.  In accordance with ISO
   14040/44, this information should be considered as part of the
   sustainable strategy related to energy efficiency.  Also, refer to
   the ecodesign framework [(EU) 2024/1781] published in June by the
   European Commission.

6.1.  Carbon Reporting

   To report on carbon equivalents for global reporting, it is important
   to correlate the location where the specific entity/network element
   is operating with the corresponding carbon factor.  Refer to the
   world emission factor from the International Energy Agency (IEA),
   electricity maps applications that reflect the carbon intensity of
   the electricity consumed, etc.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


6.2.  Energy Mix

   To facilitate carbon reporting for global reporting, it is important
   to know the type of energy that network devices are consuming, such
   as solar energy, wind energy, cogeneration, etc.

7.  Control of Entities

   Many entities control their Power State locally.  Other entities need
   interfaces for an Energy Management System to control their Power
   State.

   A power supply is typically not self-managed by devices, and control
   of a power supply is typically not conducted as an interaction
   between an Energy Management System and the device itself.  It is
   rather an interaction between the management system and a device
   providing power at its Power Outlets.  Similar to Power State
   control, power supply control may be policy driven.  Note that
   shutting down the power supply abruptly may have severe consequences
   for the device.

7.1.  Provisioning Power States

   The standard must provide means for provisioning Power States of
   entities.

   When an Energy Object is set to a particular Power State, the
   represented device or component may be busy.  The Energy Object
   should set the desired Power State and then update the actual Power
   State when the device or component changes.  The standard must
   provide means to report the intented and applied Power States, with
   the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342]

7.2.  Controlling Power SupplyProvisioning

   The standard must provide means for switching a power supply off or
   turning a power supply on at Power Interfaces providing power to one
   or more devices.

7.3.  Controlling Energy Saving and Optimization Functionalities

   The standard must provide means for controlling energy saving and
   optimization functionalities and allocating the committed component
   resource (e.g., adjust fan speed, shutdown high speed interface) or
   committed device resource (e.g., multiple cards scheduling, multiple
   power module scheduling).

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


   In addition, the standard must provide means to support both local
   management and network wide management based on energy saving
   functionality.

8.  Reporting on Other Entities

   As discussed in Section 5, not all energy-related information may be
   available at the entity in question.  Such information may be
   provided by other entities.  This section covers only the reporting
   of information.  See Section 8 for requirements on controlling other
   entities.

   There are cases where a power supply unit switches power for several
   entities by turning power on or off at a single Power Outlet or where
   a power meter measures the accumulated power of several entities at a
   single power line.  Consequently, it should be possible to report
   that a monitored value does not relate to just a single entity but is
   an accumulated value for a set of entities.  All of the entities
   belonging to that set need to be identified.

8.1.  Reports on Other Entities

   The standard must provide means for an entity to report information
   on another entity.

8.2.  Identity of Other Entities on Which Information Is Reported

   For entities that report on one or more other entities, the standard
   must provide means for reporting the identity of other entities on
   which information is reported.  Note that, in some situations, a
   manual configuration might be required to populate this information.

8.3.  Reporting Quantities Accumulated over Multiple Entities

   The standard must provide means for reporting the list of all
   entities from which contributions are included in an accumulated
   value.

8.4.  List of All Entities on Which Information Is Reported

   For entities that report on one or more other entities, the standard
   must provide means for reporting the complete list of all those
   entities on which energy-related information can be reported.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


8.5.  Content of Reports on Other Entities

   For entities that report on one or more other entities, the standard
   must provide means for indicating what type or types of energy-
   related information can be reported, and for which entities.

9.  Controlling Other Entities

   This section specifies requirements for controlling Power States and
   power supply of entities by communicating with other entities that
   have the means for doing that control.

9.1.  Controlling Power States of Other Entities

   RFC6988 allow some entities have control over Power States of other
   entities, e.g., in Building automation case where a gateway to a
   building system may have the means to control the Power State of
   entities in the building that do not have an IP interface.

   In this document, we assume all network devices have IP connectivity
   in the operator controlled environment.  Therefore only an Energy
   Management System has control over Power States of other entities.

   In addition, it is required that an entity that has its state
   controlled by the Energy Management System has the means to report
   the list of these other entities.

9.1.1.  Control of Power States of Other Entities

   The standard must provide means for an Energy Management System to
   send Power State control commands to an entity that controls the
   Power States of entities other than the entity to which the command
   was sent.

9.1.2.  Identity of Other Power State Controlled Entities

   The standard must provide means for reporting the identities of the
   entities for which the reporting entity has the means to control
   their Power States.  Note that, in some situations, a manual
   configuration might be required to populate this information.

9.1.3.  List of All Power State Controlled Entities

   The standard must provide means for an entity to report the list of
   all entities for which it can control the Power State.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


9.1.4.  List of All Power State Controllers

   The standard must provide means for an entity that receives commands
   controlling its Power State from other entities to report the list of
   all those entities.

9.2.  Controlling Power Supply

   Some entities may have control of the power supply of other entities,
   for example, because the other entity is supplied via a Power Outlet
   of the entity.  For this and similar cases, means are needed to make
   this control accessible to the Energy Management System.  This need
   is already addressed by the requirement in Section 6.2.

   In addition, it is required that an entity that has its supply
   controlled by other entities has the means to report the list of
   these other entities.  This need is already addressed by requirements
   in Sections 5.2.3 and 5.2.4.

10.  Security Considerations

   Controlling Power State and power supply of entities are considered
   highly sensitive actions, since they can significantly affect the
   operation of directly and indirectly connected devices.  Therefore,
   all control actions addressed in Sections 6 and 8 must be
   sufficiently protected through authentication, authorization, and
   integrity protection mechanisms.

   Entities that are not sufficiently secure to operate directly on the
   public Internet do exist and can be a significant cause of risk, for
   example, if the remote control functions described in Sections 6 and
   8 can be exercised on those devices from anywhere on the Internet.
   The standard needs to provide means for dealing with such cases.  One
   solution is providing means that allow the isolation of such devices,
   e.g., behind a sufficiently secured gateway.  Another solution is to
   allow compliant implementations to disable sensitive functions, or to
   not implement such functions at all.

   The monitoring of energy-related quantities of an entity as addressed
   in Sections 5 through 8 can be used to derive more information than
   just the received and provided energy; therefore, monitored data
   requires protection.  This protection includes authentication and
   authorization of entities requesting access to monitored data as well
   as confidentiality protection during transmission of monitored data.
   Privacy of stored data in an entity must be taken into account.
   Monitored data may be used as input to control, accounting, and other
   actions, so integrity of transmitted information and authentication
   of the origin may be needed.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Energy Efficiency Manag       July 2024


10.1.  Secure Energy Management

   The standard must provide privacy, integrity, and authentication
   mechanisms for all actions addressed in Sections 5 through 8.  The
   security mechanisms must meet the security requirements detailed in
   Section 1.4 of [RFC3411].

10.2.  Isolation of Insufficiently Secure Entities

   The standard must provide means to allow the isolation of entities
   that are not sufficiently secure to operate on the public Internet,
   e.g., behind a gateway that implements sufficient security that the
   vulnerable entities are not directly exposed to the Internet.

10.3.  Optional Restriction of Functions

   The standard must allow compliant implementations to disable
   sensitive functions, or to not implement such functions at all, when
   operating in environments that are not sufficiently secured.  This
   applies particularly to the control functions described in Sections 6
   and 8.

12.  Open Issues to be Discussed at the BoF

   o EMAN "eco system" includes many MIBs.  Which one are largely
   deployed?  Will they/How can they benefit of the GREEN works ?

   o Battery use cases migh be different 10 years after.  Should it be
   addressed in a future charter?  So far the decision is no.
   Nevertheless it might be generalized to cover backup sources of
   energy capabilities and use.

   o Do we need to keep a reference to the MIB object entPhysicalUUID
   (in section 4.4 from ENTITY-MIB v4) in case of legacy device (MIB)?

   o The EMAN requirements and EMAN framework had a lot of emphasis on t
   he "Reporting on Other Entities", typically smart PDU or PoE.  Is
   this important?  Should this be removed?  Should it be addressed in a
   future charter?  This is text about "Sections 7 and 8 contain
   requirements specific to Energy Management.  Due to the nature of
   power supply, some monitoring and control functions are not conducted
   by interacting with the entity of interest but rather with other
   entities, for example, entities upstream in a power distribution
   tree."

   Expressed differently: Out of scope for the short term approach of
   EMAN framework enhancements, but might be good to call it out, EMAN
   doesn't include mechanisms for integrating occupancy sensors or user
   behavior analytics, which can be critical for optimizing HVAC, l
   ighting, and other systems for energy efficiency.  This is a key
   aspect for Smart Buildings and Data Centers energy efficiency
   metrics.

   o It's not clear whether we need new Power State (Set)?  Maybe not
   but we need to explain the mapping of existing energy efficient
   features to specific Power States.

   o basic (scalar) units are not enough to describe Power Data Unit
   capabilities and/or output.  We need a more complex structure (which
   might already exist?) to cover and combine meanings (that I copied
   from the chats) like CO2 footprint, clean energy, mix, renewable. as
   an example, this should help to describe reduction of energy
   consumption and the increase of renewable energy consumption

   o Enhance EMAN framework, to support a more robust and comprehensive
   Energy Efficiency Strategy.  Let devices report whatever they can
   using existing interfaces, without waiting until they implement new
   capabilities determined by new or existing standards.  Including the
   capability to integrate with external data sources (for example, for
   devices that don't have the capability or reporting any energy-
   related metrics) such as vendor datasheets that provide energy
   consumption.  Use case => upgrading a device for better Energy
   Efficiency Management.  Not sure whether framework-related
   requirements should be covered here.

   o Leveraging existing devices modularity to introduce eco-designed
   components in the networks while being able to assess the gains in
   sustainability.  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-stephan-
   legacy-path-eco-design-01 https://github.com/emile22/sustainability

   o There is a need to reflect component on/off frequency capacity (in
   YANG) to avoid too intensive power on/off.

   o There is a need to support a description of the different nature of
   the sources of the energy used (mix).  It should be flexible are the
   types of sources might augment in the future.
